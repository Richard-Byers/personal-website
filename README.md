This is my personal portfolio website.

It was made using NextJS and TailwindCSS, hosted using Firebase's free tier.

If you wish to fork and re-use this for your own portfolio, within the next section are steps to get this up and running locally.

### Setup

1. Make sure you have Node, npm and NextJS installed first.
2. Clone this repo by using the `git clone` command.
3. Ensure you are using node 23.10.0 and NextJS 15 as that is what I used for this project.
4. Run `npm install` to pull and install all of the dependencies.
5. Run `npm run dev` to run the dev build.
6. To run production build locally, run `npm run build`, wait for it to build and then run `npm start` .
